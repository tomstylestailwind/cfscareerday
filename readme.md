# Welcome to the CFS Career Day Code
All code written with the help of the students at Colonel Frank Seely School at their careers day. 24 Nov 2021.
The idea was to create an a basic app in a day with the help of the students. The app has 2 pages. One lists movies and the other lets you see more information about a single movie. 

The completed app can be seen here. 


## Tools Used
I used the following tools. All of them are free to download and use at home.

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
This is the main tool I used to write the code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
This is a useful tool I use for looking at code

[The Movie DB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
This is where all the data for the system comes from 

[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
This is a CSS (cascading style sheet) library that lets me build websites more quickly using layout that works well on phones and bigger screens

## Languages and Frameworks

The application was developed in [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) which is a mixture of C# and HTML. It is used to create modern web applications.
A lot of web applications have an API behind them. API stands for Application Programming Interface. For this app I used the data in TheMovieDb as my API.
